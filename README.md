### Hello, I'm Ben White-Horne

I'm a software developer based in Cambridge and I currently work for MathWorks writing C++.  I generally focus on writing low-level code with a focus on reliability and performance.

Outside of work I often work on side projects which can be found either here on GitHub or on [my website](https://kneasle.github.io).  I also play trombone and drums, ring and make compositions for church bells, make lots of [geometric modular origami](https://www.instagram.com/kneasle/), and play pool and snooker.

Here are some GitHub stats:
